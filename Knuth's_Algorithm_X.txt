Algorithm X is a recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm 
that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem.

The exact cover problem is represented in Algorithm X by a matrix A consisting of 
0s and 1s. The goal is to select a subset of the rows such that the digit 1 appears 
in each column exactly once.

Algorithm X functions as follows:
	1. If the matrix has no columns then terminate successfully  
	2. Choose a column 'c'
	3. Choose a row 'r' search that Arc = 1
	4. In that row for all column 'j' which have Arj = 1, select those columns 
	5. Now for each column in this group of selected columns,select all rows 'i' 
	   having Aij = 1, for each column selected in step 4.
	6. Delete all the group of selected columns in step 4 and selected rows in Step 5.
	7. Now repeat this steps from 1 to 6 until all the columns are deleted completely 

In this recursion at last when all the columns of the matrix is deleted then the rows 
selected at Step 3 when kept in order forms the cover(i.e. our final solution)

Any systematic rule for choosing column c in this procedure will find all solutions, 
but some rules work much better than others. To reduce the number of iterations, 
Knuth suggested that in the column-choosing algorithm select a column with the 
smallest number of 1s in it.
